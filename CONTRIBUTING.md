To ensure nice and clean development, please consider paying attention to some rules if you want to help me out:

If contributing an ISSUE:
Title: 
      - short but recognizable 
Description:
      - what exactly is the issue? (bug, idea, ...)
      - any idea how to fix/implement it?
      - which parts of the program does it affect?
      - how extensive would that be?
      - how important is it?
      
If contributing a PULL REQUEST:
Title: 
      - short but recognizable 
Description:
      - what exactly did you change/add/remove?
      - why?
      - is this completely done or just the begin of an implementation?
      - how extensive would it be to be implemented fully?
      - how important is it?
      
I thank everyone for new ideas concerning my projects.
