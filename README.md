# Simulation
a physics simulation engine

Use this program to simulate different physical simulations in the branch of mechanics.
This executable is able to read out special code files.
To create them, use the special helping tool: the repository 'Simulation-Setup' available on my GitHub (@Fractum34254).
If you find bugs or have issues with using this engine, contact me and I'll try to help.

Important: 
This engine is not a guaranteed bug-free project and is not made to fit for particular purposes. 
It is a non-commercial project and I just created it to develop myself in C++.
